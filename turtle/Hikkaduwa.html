                                       <p>The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is a refuge dedicated to sea turtle conservation and protection. We offer a secure environment for turtle eggs to hatch and care for wounded or sick turtles until they may be returned to the sea.</p>
                                       <p>Visitors may learn about different turtle species, their life cycles, and the obstacles they encounter in the wild at the hatchery. We provide educational programs and guided excursions to encourage turtle conservation and responsible tourism.</p> <p>You may also join in the release of newborn turtles into the sea at the hatchery, a wonderful event that helps to preserve these magnificent creatures.</p>
