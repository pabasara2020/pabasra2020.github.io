          <div class="threats-area">
         <p>Due to the fact that they are frequently taken as inadvertent bycatch, <br>
         sea turtles suffer from overfishing. Most of the time, they suffer injuries<br>
         and pass away. Less sustainable fishing practices harm ecosystems and natural <br>
         food chains, which can have an impact on sea turtles' surroundings. Ascension<br>
          Bay in Curaçao, where there is a significant migration of Sargassum seaweed, is <br>
          one place where we observe similar impacts. The seaweed is prospering because of<br>
           the changes in habitats. Sargassum seaweed prevents any life underneath it from <br>
           surviving. The sea turtles who enter it may fatigue and are unable to exit it due <br>
           to this. They dry out and pass away under the hot sun.</p>

           <h1>Climate change & Ocean contamination</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="threats-area">
          <p>Sea turtle survival may be impacted by habitat changes brought on by climate change. <br>
            One of these elements is the temperature increase, which has an impact on a nest's<br>
             temperature. While they are still in the eggs, hatchlings' gender is influenced by<br>
              the temperature. More females are born as a result of higher temperatures. The <br>
               of the species as a whole may be impacted by the overabundance of female sea turtles.
                   <br>
                   <br>
              Another danger is ocean pollution, which has contributed to a rise in <br>
               (tumor) instances in sea turtles, especially those in the area near Curaçao. <br>
               Other long-term health problems in sea turtles may result from the rise in pollutants<br>
                in the water.</p>

           <h1> Pollution</h1>
         </div> 
          <div class="threats-area">
          <p>One of the biggest dangers to marine turtles is pollution. They are unable to swim <br>
             out for air because they become caught in phantom nets. Thus, they are suffocated. <br>
             Additionally, they are susceptible to being caught in tiny fragments of nets and other <br>
             floating debris. These might hurt them, cause limb loss, and cause other issues. Hooks<br>
              dropped by fisherman have the potential to puncture their thick skin, become trapped, or <br>
               even be ingested along with food.
                  <br>
                  <br>
           Sea turtles are greatly endangered by plastic pollution because they may confuse floating<br>
            pieces of plastic for food. The sea turtles are unable to feed and correctly digest food <br>
            because of the obstructions in their intestines and stomachs.</p>

          <div class="threats-area">
         <p>Turtle flesh and eggs are prized delicacies in some societies. Because sea turtles are endangered,<br>
             it is forbidden to shoot or eat them. Nevertheless, they are frequently stolen. For their flesh,<br>
              poached turtles are traded. The nests may be removed, and the eggs may be purchased and eaten.</p>

          <p>Real estate investors may be drawn to the beaches that sea turtles select for their nests.<br>
             To accommodate human'recreational' and entertainment activities, resorts are constructed,<br>
              and beaches are modified. The number of beaches where sea turtles may nest decreases. <br>
              Sea turtles can also be disturbed by bright lights, sunbeds, noise, campfires, and other<br>
               human activity on beaches. Less eggs and hatchlings are produced as a result of fewer <br>
                sea turtles being able to nest or complete nesting, which leads to a decline in the<br>
                 overall population.</p>
