 <h3><c style="color:#000000" class="GT">The leatherback turtle is the largest of all sea turtles and one of the largest reptiles on the planet,<br> measuring 4-8 feet in length (1.2-2.4 meters) and weighing 500-2,000 pounds (225-900 kg). <br>The average adult is 5-6 feet tall (1.5-1.8 m) and weighs 600-800 pounds (270-360 kg).

    <br>It is the oldest of all sea turtle species, having existed for more than 150 million years!<br> They survived the dinosaur extinction and thrived until the last few decades, when<br> human interactions took their toll.

 <h3><d style="color:#000000" class="GT">After the leatherback, the green sea turtle is the second biggest.<br>
     They may weigh up to 500 pounds (225 kilograms) and grow to be four<br> 
     feet (1.2 meters) long. The adult is a herbivore that feeds on sea grasses,<br> 
    seaweeds, algae, and other marine plant life. Their beaks are pointed and <br>
    sharply serrated, making them ideal for feeding in seagrass beds and scraping<br>
     algae off hard surfaces.This is the only species that comes to the coast to bask<br>
      on a regular basis. Basking is only found in Hawaii, namely the Northwestern<br>
       Hawaiian Island chain, the Galapagos Islands, and parts of Australia.

 <img src="S-S-S-SEA TURTLES TIME!!!.jpg" alt="Snow"  class=image style="width:250" height="210">
 
 <c style="color:#000000" class="GT">The hawksbill sea turtle is found in tropical regions all over the world and <br>
  is considered by many to be the most beautiful of sea turtles due to its multicolored <br>
  shells.They like coral reefs, rocky places, lagoons, mangroves, oceanic islands, and shallow <br>
   coastal areas.Hawksbills, so named because of its tiny head and sharp, bird-like beak, can <br>
   reach into the cracksand crevices of coral reefs in search of food. Their diet is quite <br>
   specialized, consisting nearly entirely on sponges. Adults of this smaller turtle weigh<br> 
   100-200 pounds (45-90 kg) and grow tobe 2-3 feet (5 to 1 meter) long.

   200-400 pounds (90-180 kg) and reaching lengths of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters).<br>
    They may be found in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans' temperate and <br>
    tropical zones.They are called for their huge head and strong crushing jaw <br>
    , which allows them to consume hard-shelled food such as crabs, conchs, and <br>
    whelks. They are one of the most numerous species found in the United States.

      <td>Strong front flippers and a teardrop-shaped body allow for cruising speeds above 8 kph and diving depths of 1,200 m. The only reptile capable of producing metabolic heat (endothermy), combined with a circulatory system that uses countercurrent heat exchange, allows for body temperatures up to 18°C higher than the water's surface. Lays every two to five years, repeating her nesting every ten days. Nest 75 cm deep in moist sand; eggs range in size from 65 to 115 and are 5.3 cm in diameter. 60–70 days of incubation; hatchlings are slightly over 6 cm long.</td>

      <td>Shy, biennial nester that frequents small beaches on numerous isolated islands and typically digs a shallower nest than other species do beneath cover of coastal flora. 120–160 eggs each clutch; up to six nests per season; 60 days for incubation.</td>

      <td>The most noticeable characteristic is the huge, synchronized nesting, or 'arribada' (Spanish for arrival), when hundreds of thousands of females lay their eggs simultaneously over the course of two to three days on a small section of beach. Since its primary nesting beaches are continental, this behavior, which often occurs around the new moon, serves to drown out predator pressure.

        However, when females dig out one another's nests, a lot of eggs are lost. While clutch sizes vary, they typically contain over 100 eggs per nest and lay one to three times per season. The incubation period is brief—roughly 45–50 days—but not brief enough to protect against the next arribada, which is timed according to the lunar cycle.</td>
